what happen for late arrivals,"I'm assuming you're referring to company policies regarding late arrivals. 

According to our company's HR policies, if an employee arrives late to work, they will be required to report to the HR department and provide a valid reason for their late arrival. 

A late arrival is defined as entering the workplace after the scheduled start time. Firstly, employees are expected to try and arrive on time for their scheduled start. 

Late arrivals without a valid reason will result in a verbal warning from the HR department. A late arrival is defined as more than 15 minutes past the scheduled start time.

For a second instance of being late within a 6-month period, a written warning will be issued from the HR department.

For further instances, this may result in a final written warning and potential disciplinary actions, depending on the company's disciplinary policy.

Please note that these policies can be subject to change. If you have any further questions or concerns about our late arrival policies, please do not hesitate to reach out to me or your department head.

Also note that if you arrived late, kindly submit a 'Late Arrival Report' (template available on our company intranet) to the HR department with the details of the reason, and date/time of late arrival.","[8, 7, 6, 5, 4]"
what happens for late arrivals,"According to our company's attendance policy, late arrivals are monitored and tracked by the HR department. For late arrivals that are due to personal or family emergencies, employees will need to submit a Late Arrival Explanation Form to HR, which will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

For instances of tardiness that are not due to personal or family emergencies, the employee will be subject to the following actions:

- A first-time late arrival will receive a verbal warning from the supervisor.
- A second late arrival within a 2-week period will result in a written warning from HR.
- Three or more late arrivals within a 4-week period will lead to a meeting with the employee's supervisor and HR to discuss the reasons for the tardiness and develop a plan to improve attendance.

Repeated instances of late arrivals may also result in disciplinary actions, up to and including a paid suspension.","[8, 7, 6, 5, 4]"

To avoid any disciplinary action, employees are recommended to report their expected late arrival to their supervisor or HR representative in advance, whenever possible, and discuss possible reasons or arrangements for their late arrival.
